# learning_log_pcc_chapter20
Tutorial project from the book Python Crash Course by ehmatthes

In this Django project (Django is a Python framework), you can log your learning process. Enjoy it!

In the book's tutorial there were some issues with the deployment process because of changes in the heroku platform.
More about these issues: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/xrudzd/creating_a_superuser_on_heroku_pcc_chapter_20/

Considering these issues, i opted to focus in the system funcionality. There's no deploy.
