# learning_log_pcc_chapter20
Tutorial project from the book Python Crash Course by ehmatthes

In this Django project (Django is a Python framework), you can log your learning process. Enjoy it!

<<<<<<< HEAD
In the book's tutorial there were some issues with the deployment process because of changes in the heroku platform. More about these issues: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/xrudzd/creating_a_superuser_on_heroku_pcc_chapter_20/ ehmatthes/learning_log_2e_django40#1

Considering these issues, i opted to focus in the system funcionality. There's no deploy.
